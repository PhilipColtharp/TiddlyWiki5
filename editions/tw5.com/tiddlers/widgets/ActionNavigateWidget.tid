! Introduction

The ''action-navigate'' widget is an [[action widget|ActionWidgets]] that sends a [[tm-navigate|WidgetMessage: tm-navigate]] message back up the widget tree. ActionWidgets are used within triggering widgets such as the ButtonWidget.

! Content and Attributes

The ''action-navigate'' widget is invisible. Any content within it is ignored.

|!Attribute |!Description |
|$to |The title of the target tiddler for the navigation (if not provided defaults to the [[WidgetVariable: currentTiddler]] |
|$scroll |Optional parameter determining whether the navigation will also cause a scroll to the target tiddler (see below) |
|$to-random |A [[filter|Filter]] expression.  Navigates to a random tiddler in the resulting list of tiddlers created aplying the [[filter|Filter]] expression against the store of tiddlers in the wiki.  If the [[filter|Filter]] expression creates an empty list, navigation defaults to content in the $to attribute. |
!! Scroll handling

The optional `$scroll` attribute can be set to "yes" to force scrolling to occur to bring the target tiddler into view. If set to "no" then scrolling does not occur. If the `$scroll` attribute is omitted then scrolling occurs unless either:

* the control key is pressed
* the action was initiated with the middle mouse button (if available)

! Examples

Here is an example of button that navigates to two different tiddlers at once:

<$macrocall $name='wikitext-example-without-html'
src='<$button>
<$action-navigate $to="ButtonWidget" $scroll="no"/>
<$action-navigate $to="ActionWidgets"/>
Click me!
</$button>'/>
